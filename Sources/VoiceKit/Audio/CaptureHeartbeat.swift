//  How long since the microphone last handed us a buffer.
//
//  A dead capture is silent in exactly the same way a quiet room is, so the app
//  cannot tell them apart from the transcript alone — which is how a session ends
//  up running for a full minute having heard nothing at all. Buffers, unlike
//  speech, arrive continuously whether or not anyone is talking, so their absence
//  is unambiguous: the audio path is broken.
