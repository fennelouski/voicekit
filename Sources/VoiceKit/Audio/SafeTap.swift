//  Installing a microphone tap without betting the process on it.
//
//  `installTap(onBus:bufferSize:format:block:)` does not return an error when the
//  format it is handed disagrees with the hardware — it raises, and a raise that
//  reaches Swift takes the app down. The disagreement is easy to provoke: unplug a
//  pair of headphones, change the system input, or simply leave the app running
//  long enough for AVAudioEngine's idea of the input format to go stale.
//
//  Every tap in VoiceKit goes through here so that failure is a failed recording
//  rather than a crash.
